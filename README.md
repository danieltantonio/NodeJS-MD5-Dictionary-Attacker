# NodeJS-MD5-Dictionary-Attacker
An MD5 dictionary attack project written in Node.js

After watching ethical hacking videos about Python on YouTube, I decided to make my own dictionary attacker but in Node.js. 
I wanted a reason to practice file systems with Node.js but also create something that would be pretty cool and quick.
I don't think I'm going to expand on this project more, so I think it would be safe to say that I'm done with this first and only commit.
Feel free to let me know what you think of it. I'm really open to constructive criticizm.
